# Nuitka_Compiler_Gui
Nuitka_Compiler_Gui for Python with AHK

No-code compiler for python. 

From the gui it will provide multiple command options and icon options, and build a small bat file before running and deleting bat file. Also includes options to install and read dox. By default it will compile a standalone exe for any Python file, with Nuitka, at the relative path.
