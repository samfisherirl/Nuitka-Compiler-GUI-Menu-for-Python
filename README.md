# Nuitka_Compiler_Gui
Nuitka_Compiler_Gui for Python with AHK

No-code compiler for python. I have a dislike for py2exe with the flags it raises in windows defender. I have found Nuitka to be a far superior platform (Im no expert if you try to debate me on thhis I will immediately concede but extensive reading has led me to this conclusion).

From the gui it will install Nuikta, provide multiple command options and icon options, and build a small bat file before running and deleting bat file. By default it will compile a standalone exe for any Python file, with Nuitka, at the relative path.
